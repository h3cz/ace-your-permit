- **Secondary:** Create an engaging, habit-forming study experience through gamification
- **Tertiary:** Build a community of learners through leaderboards and social features

### Target Audience
- First-time drivers (ages 15-18)
- Adults seeking their first license
- International drivers converting to Illinois licenses
- Anyone needing to renew or retake their written exam

---

## 2. App Name & Branding Concept

### 2.1 App Name Options

After careful consideration of market positioning, memorability, and domain availability, we recommend the following options:

#### **Option 1: DriveMaster** (Recommended)
- **Rationale:** Combines "Drive" with "Master," implying expertise and achievement. The name is professional yet approachable, suggesting the user will become a master of driving knowledge.
- **Pros:** Easy to remember, conveys competence, works well for all demographics
- **Cons:** Common word combination may have trademark considerations

#### **Option 2: PermitPal**
- **Rationale:** Friendly, approachable name that positions the app as a companion/helper. The alliteration makes it memorable.
- **Pros:** Warm, friendly tone; clearly communicates purpose
- **Cons:** May feel too juvenile for adult learners

#### **Option 3: LicenseLab**
- **Rationale:** Suggests a scientific, methodical approach to learning. Appeals to users who want a structured study experience.
- **Pros:** Professional, implies thoroughness and testing
- **Cons:** Less emotionally engaging; "Lab" might feel clinical

#### **Option 4: RoadReady**
- **Rationale:** Directly addresses the end goal - being ready for the road. Action-oriented and motivating.
- **Pros:** Clear value proposition, motivational
- **Cons:** Somewhat generic; may be harder to trademark

#### **Option 5: TestTrack**
- **Rationale:** Combines testing with the concept of a race track, suggesting speed and progress.
- **Pros:** Dynamic, suggests quick progress
- **Cons:** May imply racing, which could be negative for safety-focused content

### 2.2 Mascot/Character Design Concept

**Character Name:** "Dash"

**Concept:** A friendly, animated car character with personality traits inspired by successful app mascots like Duolingo's Owl.

**Visual Design:**
- **Appearance:** Cute, compact car with expressive headlights for eyes and a bumper that forms a smile
- **Color:** Primary brand blue with accent colors that change based on user achievements
- **Personality:** Encouraging, slightly cheeky, celebrates wins and provides gentle motivation during struggles
- **Animations:** 
  - Celebratory bounce when user answers correctly
  - Thoughtful "thinking" animation during question loading
  - Sad but encouraging expression when user answers incorrectly
  - Excited celebration for streak milestones

**Character Variations:**
- **Classic Dash:** Default appearance
- **Graduation Dash:** Wearing a cap and gown (unlocked after passing practice test)
- **Super Dash:** With cape and superhero mask (unlocked at high XP levels)
- **Road Trip Dash:** With luggage and sunglasses (unlocked after completing all categories)

Accent Purple:   #8B5CF6 (Achievements, special features)

```

**Typography:**
- **Headings:** Inter (Bold, modern, excellent readability)
- **Body:** Inter (Clean, professional)
- **Accent/Fun:** Nunito (Rounded, friendly for mascot dialog)

**Visual Principles:**
- Clean, spacious layouts with plenty of white space

-- Profiles: Users can only read/update their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- User stats: Read own, system updates
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own stats"
  ON user_stats FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Questions: Public read-only
CREATE POLICY "Questions are publicly readable"
  ON questions FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated, anon
  USING (is_active = true);

-- Attempts: Users can only create/view their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own attempts"
  ON user_attempts FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own attempts"
  ON user_attempts FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
