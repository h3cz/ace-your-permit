## What Makes This Different

Most driving test apps are boring quiz sites covered in ads. Ace Your Permit is built for anyone procrastinating on their Illinois permit test — teens, adults, new residents, retakers, all of it:

- **Gamification that works** — XP, 20 levels, daily streaks, achievements, weekly leagues (Bronze to Diamond)
- **Dash the mascot** — a hype-beast car who explains your mistakes in Gen Z language
- **AI explanations** — powered by synthetic.new, Dash tells you WHY you got it wrong
- **Head-to-head challenges** — challenge friends with a shareable link, compare scores
- **Test day countdown** — readiness score tracks your weak categories so you know when you're ready
- **Share your score** — achievement cards optimized for Instagram Stories and TikTok
- **Parent progress updates** — parents get weekly email digests of their teen's study progress
- **Works offline** — PWA that installs on your phone
- **Two languages** — English + Spanish UI
